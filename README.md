# Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using MATLAB

This repository contains an implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using MATLAB. The ANN is a machine learning model inspired by the biological neural networks in the human brain. It can be used for various tasks such as classification, regression, pattern recognition, and prediction.

# Features

Flexible architecture: The implementation allows for creating ANNs with different configurations, including the number of layers, number of neurons per layer, and activation functions.
Training algorithms: The repository includes popular training algorithms such as backpropagation, gradient descent, and stochastic gradient descent to train the ANN.
Customization: You can customize the ANN by choosing the appropriate number of hidden layers, adjusting the learning rate, and selecting the activation functions to suit your specific problem.

# Dependencies

MATLAB (R2019b or later)
